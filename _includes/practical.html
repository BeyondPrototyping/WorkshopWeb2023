		The workshop will be hosted at CHI2023 <a href="https://chi2023.acm.org/" target="_blank" class="link-info">(https://chi2023.acm.org)</a> and consists of a 1-day (9:00 am to 3:00 pm) in-person event. We expect roughly 20 participants. We plan a series of activities to learn about each otherâ€™s work and interests, present personal perspectives, work in small teams, and participate in moderated discussions. We encourage participants to bring prototypes and show videos of their work to ground the interactive discussions.
