	Electronics prototyping boards such as Arduino, BBC micro:bit, and Raspberry Pi, work with a variety of software tools to enable a wide variety of creators with and without an engineering background — including students and researchers — to rapidly and inexpensively create interactive prototypes. By opening up the process of prototyping to more creators, and by making it cheaper and quicker, these prototyping platforms and toolkits have enabled research and explorations that weave computing into the fabric of the world around us. Today, however, the most successful platforms follow a particular format: they are based on a rigid circuit board comprising a microcontroller and general-purpose expansion ports or pins. While these technologies support prototyping pretty effectively, <strong class="fw-bold text-muted">we think there is still an opportunity for a more diverse set of technologies to further empower an even broader set of technology designers, engineers, makers, and researchers</strong>.
