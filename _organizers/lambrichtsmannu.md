Mannu Lambrichts is a Ph.D. student at Hasselt University, Belgium. He works under the supervision of Prof. dr. Raf Ramakers and focuses on facilitating building interactive electronic prototypes. 
While increasingly more people start creating custom electronic prototypes, common off-the-shelf electronic components are still (too) challenging to select and interconnect, and pre-build toolkits are too limited in what they can do. After characterizing various electronic modules [http://etclassification.com](http://etclassification.com){:target="_blank"}, Mannu decided to build on existing approaches' strengths to bring plug-and-play experience to common off-the-shelf components. Therefore, he introduced a software configurable converter board that automatically sets voltages, currents, and communication protocols to drive a wide variety of electronic components.
