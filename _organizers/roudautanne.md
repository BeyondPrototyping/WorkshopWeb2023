I am a Professor of Human-Computer Interaction and head of the Bristol Interaction Group in the Computer Science Department at the University of Bristol (UK). My research is rooted within Human Computer Interaction although I am working toward creating synergies with Material Engineering and Soft Robotics. I believe that the static shape of computers is the bottleneck of todayâ€™s interactive systems. We need shape-changing computers that are malleable and reconfigure into any shapes and provide affordances that unleash users interactive potential. However, despite tremendous breakthroughs in advanced materials, their implementation is far off because we don't understand how to support interactions with them. My research approach is a blend of theory, experimentation, and software/hardware design and my goal is to help designers create the best possible interfaces and devices we will soon have in our hands.
