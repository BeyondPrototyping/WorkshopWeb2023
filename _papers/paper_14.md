abstract: "Prototyping toolkits excel at creating proof-of-concept systems for novel hardware yet fall short for some elements of HCI research, such as IoT and wearable prototypes, which have specific form-factor or interface constraints. Single board computers are in high demand and are increasingly treated as components, while previous-generation mobile devices become e-waste. Our experiences of HCI research prototypes have persuaded us that there is an argument for allowing mobile devices to be repurposed as electronic toolkit components and that there is scope to extend prototyping toolkits to higher-level concerns, such as user interfaces."
