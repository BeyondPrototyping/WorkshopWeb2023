abstract: "Prototyping toolkits excel at creating proof-of-concept systems for novel hardware yet, for some elements of HCI research, such as IoT and wearable prototypes, with specific form-factor or interface constraints, do not entirely satisfy the requirements. Single board computers are in high demand and are increasingly treated as components, while previous-generation mobile devices become e-waste. Our experiences of HCI research prototypes lead us to believe there is an argument for allowing mobile devices to be repurposed as electronic toolkit components and that, in addition, there is scope to extend prototyping toolkits to higher-level concerns such as user interfaces."
