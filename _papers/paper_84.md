abstract: "Our research focuses on force-augmented interactions on deformable displays, requiring the design and construction of interactive surfaces that can (1) dynamically alter their stiffness; (2) allow users to apply force to physically `push through' them and (3) apply force back on the users' fingers. However, these displays are complex to fabricate, limiting their availability. In this position paper, we propose force-responsive display breakout boards, which would provide off-the-shelf, self-contained deformable surfaces that can be used to study force-responsive interactions in various settings, including workshops or user studies. These boards would realise the availability and simplicity of breakout boards and prototype kits in studying force-responsive displays. We explore the challenges associated with designing and fabricating force-responsive displays, propose key features and functionalities, and discuss two concepts for possible examples of such boards, highlighting the potential uses and significant benefits this type of board could offer to the HCI community."
