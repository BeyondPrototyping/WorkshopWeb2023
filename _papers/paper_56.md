abstract: "Open and accessible design and fabrication of silicon appear to be a solution to the structural weaknesses of the microelectronics industry. For HCI researchers, makers, and educators, this provides new opportunities to develop flexible and extendable prototyping solutions that span all levels of abstraction from transistor to prototype, to low-volume production run product. By opening up designs and tools, we can break down information barriers between the layers of abstraction. The accessibility of this novel approach will mean software and hardware tools can be supercharged to help researchers and makers realize their ideas more easily."
