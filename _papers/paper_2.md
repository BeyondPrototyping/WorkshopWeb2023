abstract: "The proliferation of “low-barrier to entry” prototyping platforms in the last decade has enabled a wide range of individuals to unlock creative ideas and turn them into interactive devices which sense, actuate and communicate in surprisingly novel ways. However, the potential of these ideas and devices are often limited by practical barriers resulting in creative projects stalling or being abandoned altogether.
This paper argues that these trends are not necessarily the result of a lack “novel” development boards but caused by practical issues stemming from the inherent tensions in hardware R&D and the hidden barriers of PCB design & manufacture. As such this paper presents ‘MEMA’: an expandable technology stack which takes the lessons learned from experiences of hardware prototyping and attempts to ease some of the tensions inherent in hardware R&D."
