abstract: "Most printed circuit boards are made of layers – stacks of copper-coated cores, with insulating sheets sandwiched in-between. The process of making this stack (layup and bonding) is almost always performed in a factory, as a routine step in a highly-mature fabrication process. But a savvy hacker can tweak this formula. If we intercept the boards in the middle of this conventional pipeline — taking command of the layup procedure ourselves — we can insert novel structures that transform standard PCBs into dynamic, compact electro-mechanical devices.

One immediate application is in the development of reprogrammable, shape-changing materials that scale. Too often, the electronics that are inserted into these prototypes are treated as an afterthought — the result is a structure that is size-limited by a labor-intensive assembly process. We instead propose integrating actuatable materials directly into the already-established, scalable manufacturing pipeline for electronics, re-conceptualizing these “programmable surfaces” as extra-functional multilayer circuits.

So far, our work in this area has revolved around integrating pneumatic structures (i.e. electrostatic valves) into multilayer PCBs, which has allowed us to create dynamic tactile patterns and simple shape-changing robots. In order to accelerate this experimentation (and allow the wider community to participate), software tools will need to be developed that capture certain abstractions, and render them as design files that can be readily manufactured."
