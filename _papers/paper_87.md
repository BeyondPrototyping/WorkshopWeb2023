abstract: "Digital fabrication combined with accessible electronics toolkits hands potential users an opportunity for unmatched creative expression: unique physical objects enriched with digital functionality, resulting in tangible, interactive, one-of-a-kind prototypes. These means are becoming increasingly affordable, but their reach often remains focused on enthusiast environments (i.e., hobbyists) or educational spaces. To increase the adoption and relevance of such toolkits, it is essential to consider the barriers faced not only by intrinsically motivated hobbyists, but also genuine non-users, who may gain motivation through their results, and less through friction in the process at first. The consideration of two aspects, present in design tools for manufacturing is valuable: 1) a focus on remixing existing designs to lower the required effort, and 2) in-situ interaction to allow for meaningful previews in the context for which prototypes are being built. With this position paper, we want to argue for the relevance, importance, and potential for situated, low-effort, and remixing-oriented workflows for the design of interactive artifacts. We first outline existing notions of remixing and in-situ design in adjacent domains, followed by a set of opportunities that can further the adoption of making across even wider user groups."
