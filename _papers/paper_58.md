abstract: "Physical computing prototyping is complex task involving software and hardware. In continuous prototyping scenarios, diverse range of makers may encounter a variety of obstacles that arise from their differing objectives, expertise levels, and prototyping procedures. Thus, it is essential to provide makers with in-situ assistance during physical computing prototyping to bridge the gap between conception and creation. To address this issue, we have developed systems that aid makers in physical computing prototyping. Our previous research involved formative studies that identified the challenges makers face during the prototyping process. Based on the issues we discovered, we have designed systems that offer in-situ assistance in physical computing, enabling users of varying knowledge levels to prototype their concepts. In this workshop, we introduce our prior proposed systems and discuss how to support makers in different stages of the prototyping process, as the levels of a maker's expertise fluctuate over time."
