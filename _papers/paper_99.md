abstract: "Extended reality (XR) applications become increasingly established tools to support users across a broad spectrum of tasks, including teaching environments for electronics and circuit design. While these offer fascinating possibilities of visualizing learning content, they lack the possibility of physical interaction. Here, tangible input devices provide an opportunity for engaging interactions with the learning content without the possible hazards of actual electronic components. This can provide effective and efficient interactions, important for meaningful learning experiences. In this paper we present and discuss our ongoing research on a tangible XR-supported smart breadboard, utilizing the possibilities of printed electronics."
