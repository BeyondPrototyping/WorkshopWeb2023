abstract: "Embedded hardware platforms such as single-board computers (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Bela) or microcontrollers (e.g., Teensy, Arduino Uno) offer an entry point for beginners into physical computing. However, deploying neural networks into these platforms is challenging for various reasons: It requires lower-level software development skills, as machine learning toolkits are typically not incorporated into these platforms. Besides, the long compilation times burden debugging and quick prototyping and experimentation. Due to the low-resource nature of embedded hardware platforms, neural networks are usually trained on a host machine, which involves a back-and-forth of data, platforms and programming languages. We inquire how these computing ecosystems might be designed to facilitate prototyping and experimentation and integrate into existing programming workflows."
