abstract: "While electronic devices have become increasingly embedded in our daily lives and environments, these devices are rapidly made obsolete by new versions, break over time, and get thrown out as electronic waste. Meanwhile, the average consumer device can contain dozens to hundreds of electronic components that could be reused for new prototypes. The future of electronics learning, manufacturing, and design should be designed to engage with the issue of e-waste and the impact of the millions of devices that are bought and thrown out by consumers. By focusing on enabling pathways for electronic component reuse, many research opportunities emerge to enable benefits across sustainability, education, and even, electronics design. We outline specific research directions to enable a future of more ecologically conscious electronics prototyping through reuse and discuss our recent explorations in designing tools for reuse in electronic design automation (EDA) software."
