abstract: "We present an open-source web-based tool for parametric circuit board design. We developed a JavaScript-based system for describing circuits and a graphical editor which assists users in writing JavaScript programs through direct manipulation while providing full access to the textual representation of the board design. We aim to enable a future where users can programmatically generate and share boards as easily as programmers share code. Overall we would like to share how programmatic representations and bidirectional interfaces have enabled us to create a tool used by both thousands of beginner circuit designers and researchers of novel electronics fabrication processes."
