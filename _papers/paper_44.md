abstract: "We present an open-source web-based tool for parametric circuit board design. We developed a JavaScript-based system for describing circuits and a graphical editor which assists users in writing JavaScript programs through direct manipulation while providing full access to the textual representation of the board design. We aim to enable a future where users can programmatically generate and share boards as easily as programmers share code. We will share how programmatic representations and bidirectional interfaces have enabled us to create a tool used by both thousands of beginner circuit designers and researchers of novel electronics fabrication processes."
