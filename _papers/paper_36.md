abstract: "This paper for Beyond Prototyping Boards: Future Paradigms for Electronics Toolkits proposes an analogue signal processing toolbox to simplify and accelerate the design process of prototypes that require an element of signal processing. Several different stackable modules are proposed, including an instrumentation amplifier, a Sallen-Key, a notch filter and a non-inverting amplifier. Based on the authors' experience with electromyography, an example implementation is given using the proposed toolkit. It is hoped that such a toolkit could reduce development time, minimise cost and aid in teaching signal processing and signal acquisition."
