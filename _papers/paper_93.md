abstract: 'Additive manufacturing has shown phenomenal growth in recent years, enabling democratised decentralised production of free-form artefacts and prototypes. However, these are typically inactive. By adhering to the same core principles, we propose that the exploration of automated deposition of active materials has the same potential for growth within electronics fabrication. This research holds the potential to unlock new forms of electronic device and the possibility for use by non-specialists in a manner akin to domestic 3D printing. In our published work we carry out 1) explorations of automated deposition methods, 2) active material investigations and 3) research into integration of design within fabrication processes. The work that we present here explores interactive devices, as a set of implementations that benefit most from the ability for irregular form and insitu customisability related to display fabrication. However, in this position paper we argue that these three key research angles provide the potential for greater democratisation in an even broader range of electronics prototyping methods, beyond just interactive devices, such as laying of conductive traces and augmentation of passive objects with sensors.'
