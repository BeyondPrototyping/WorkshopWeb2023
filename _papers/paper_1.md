abstract: "In recent years, the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community has shown a growing preference for employing custom printed circuit boards (PCBs) in research projects involving wearable technology. Despite the advantages of this approach, such as compact form factor and increased efficiency, designing and manufacturing custom PCBs can be time-consuming, costly, and burdensome for researchers, thereby delaying the research process. Furthermore, with recent advancements in chip manufacturing technology, there has been a surge in the availability of system-on-chip (SoC) boards with sensing and communication capabilities. However, the process of choosing the appropriate development board, sensors, and prototype design strategy that align with project requirements and can function efficiently in free-living settings may present a challenge, particularly for researchers who are advanced beginners in this area. Given our experience designing embedded mobile health systems, we present a prototyping strategy for developing wearable embedded systems by identifying potential pitfalls advanced beginners face when selecting and assembling components for prototyping wearable technology research projects. We also provide practical recommendations for selecting appropriate development boards, sensors, and prototype designs, serving as a valuable guide for researchers in the field."
