abstract: 'Physical interaction technologies are popular in HCI research, yet have struggled to reach consumers. I argue that one reason is the lack of a platform â€“ not for prototyping, but for delivery of physical applications. Analogues can be drawn to previous successful platforms such as the desktop computer and the smartphone, which worked as a standardized vessel for a multitude of different applications.'
