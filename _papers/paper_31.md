abstract: "We overload “Softening Hardware” to refer to making hardware development easier, and doing so by making it more like software development. We suggest doing this by virtualizing hardware devices and lifting systems integration from embedded environments into high-level interactive ones. In our “Modular-Things” project we developed a set of single purpose circuits, a networking library for real-time communication in heterogeneous hardware, and a web-based IDE for integrating complete systems of these devices. “Modular-Things” is not just a collection of dedicated circuits, it’s a set of tools for developing modular hardware systems which can be composed in software. The future paradigm we envision is independent developers producing hardware modules which can be easily integrated into complete systems, in a manner analogous to how open-source software developers create libraries. This will be enabled by embedding integration information (like an API) within hardware modules themselves and by exposing this information in accessible interactive development environments."
