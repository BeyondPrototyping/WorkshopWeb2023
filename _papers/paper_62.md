abstract: 'We hypothesize that more inclusive Science & Technology (S&T) education requires novel phygital toolkits, combining and adapting physical material, open software and hardware, for broadening the range of expression means for diverse learners. The toolkits should also be open in that they enable for the free exploration of their inner working and related S&T knowledge. Moreover, in line with recent inclusive initiatives for learners, we propose that such toolkits should be used in socio-culturally relevant design activities for “making and use” and “collective sense-making”. Our position paper explains how we started and continue developing open phygital toolkits for inclusive S&T educational activities which are design-oriented, and example prototypes of such toolkits by authors of this paper and colleagues.'
