abstract: "Electronics prototyping boards have brought a lot of versatility in the world of prototyping, allowing designers, researchers and makers to build a variety of digital artefacts. However we see an increase in Material-Centric approaches in which active materials are manipulated to create new digital contraptions. For example programmable ink can be used in combination with conductive and non-conductive material to create a display from scratch, rather than using off-the shelf components. While those new ways of prototyping can bring new form factors in the design of interactive devices, they also come with their challenges. To start identifying those challenges and discussing these at the workshop, we build a volumetric displays with electrochromic materials. The display is driven by a MSP430 microcontroller with pins controlling each voxel separately, and by controlling the display element matrix 3D images are generated. We learn from our experience in building such device to draw insights on the feasibility of using active material to create digital devices. We hope to initiate discussions about how Material-Centric processes must also be taken into consideration when rethinking the future of prototyping."
