abstract: "3D printing technology has revolutionized the prototyping process by enabling fast and cost-efficient creation of functional prototypes. These prototypes have the potential to be disruptive as they allow testing user interaction under a range of conditions. The advancements in 3D printing functional parts will allow users to print beta prototypes that actuate, sense, and process information, enabling for rapid manufacture of initial ideas and products. This workshop paper includes how a material property and its reaction to heat can be leveraged to control functions such as resistance, leading to the creation of 3D printed fuses and switches, which opens up wide research opportunities to explore and develop 3D printed processors that can be integrated into objects during the printing process."
